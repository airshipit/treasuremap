# This catalogue gathers in one place networking configuration which must
# be coordinated among the target (undercloud) cluster and different subclusters.
# In particular, it contains `kubernetes` stanzas which are intended to be
# substituted into subclusters' networking catalogues (to be consumed by
# e.g. the k8scontrol function), and subcluster ports which must be known by
# SIP loadbalancers in the target cluster and NodePorts in the subclusters.
