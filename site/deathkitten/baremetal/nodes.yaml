# Drydock BaremetalNode resources for a specific rack are stored in this file.
#
# NOTE: For new sites, you should complete the networks/physical/networks.yaml
# file before working on this file.
#
# In this file, you should make the number of `drydock/BaremetalNode/v1`
# resources equal the number of bare metal nodes you have, either by deleting
# excess BaremetalNode definitions (if there are too many), or by copying and
# pasting the last BaremetalNode in the file until you have the correct number
# of baremetal nodes (if there are too few).
#
# Then in each file, address all additional NEWSITE-CHANGEME markers to update
# the data in these files with the right values for your new site.
#
# *NOTE: The Genesis node is counted as one of the control plane nodes. Note
# that the Genesis node does not appear on this bare metal list, because the
# procedure to reprovision the Genesis host with MaaS has not yet been
# implemented. Therefore there will be only three bare metal nodes in this file
# with the 'masters' tag, as the genesis roles are assigned in a difference
# place (profiles/genesis.yaml).
# NOTE: The host profiles for the control plane are further divided into two
# variants: primary and secondary. The only significance this has is that the
# "primary" nodes are active Ceph nodes, whereas the "secondary" nodes are Ceph
# standby nodes. For Ceph quorum, this means that the control plane split will
# be 3 primary + 1 standby host profile, and the Genesis node counts toward one
# of the 3 primary profiles. Other control plane services are not affected by
# primary vs secondary designation.
#
# TODO: Include the hostname naming convention

  # NEWSITE-CHANGEME: The IPv4 address assigned to each logical network on this
  # node. In the reference Airship deployment, this is all logical Networks defined

  # (what could possibly go wrong!) The instructions differ for each logical
  # network, which are laid out below.
  addressing:
    # The iDrac/iLo IP of the node. It's important that this match up with the
    # node's hostname above, so that the rack number and node position encoded
    # in the hostname are accurate and matching the node that IPMI operations
    # will be performed against (for poweron, poweroff, PXE boot to wipe disk or
    # reconfigure identity, etc - very important to get right for these reasons).
    # These addresses should already be assigned to nodes racked and stacked in
    # the environment; these are not addresses which MaaS assigns.
    - network: oob
      address: 192.168.1.2
    # The IP of the node on the PXE network. Refer to the static IP range
    # defined for the PXE network in networks/physical/networks.yaml. Begin allocating
    # IPs from this network, starting with the second IP (inclusive) from the
    # allocation range of this subnet (Genesis node will have the first IP).
    # Ex: If the start IP for the PXE "static" network is 10.23.20.11, then
    # genesis will have 10.23.20.11, this node will have 10.23.20.12, and
    # so on with incrementing IP addresses with each additional node.
    - network: pxe
      address: 192.168.2.12
    # Genesis node gets first IP, all other nodes increment IPs from there
    # within the allocation range defined for the network in
    # networks/physical/networks.yaml
    - network: general
      address: 192.168.242
  # NEWSITE-CHANGEME: Set the host profile for the node.
  # Note that there are different host profiles depending if this is a control
  # plane vs data plane node, and different profiles that map to different types
  # hardware. Control plane host profiles are further broken down into "primary"
  # and "secondary" profiles (refer to the Notes section at the top of this doc).
  # Select the host profile that matches up to your type of
  # hardware and function. E.g., the r720 here refers to Dell R720 hardware, the
  # 'cp' refers to a control plane profile, and the "primary" means it will be
  # an active member in the ceph quorum. Refer to profiles/host/ for the list
  # of available host profiles specific to this site (otherwise, you may find
  # a general set of host profiles at the "type" or "global" layers/folders.
  # If you have hardware that is not on this list of profiles, you may need to
  # create a new host profile for that hardware.
  # Regarding control plane vs other data plane profiles, refer to the notes at
  # the beginning of this file. There should be one control plane node per rack,
  # including Genesis. Note Genesis won't actually be listed in this file as a
  # BaremetalNode, but the rest are.
  # This is the second "primary" control plane node after Genesis.
