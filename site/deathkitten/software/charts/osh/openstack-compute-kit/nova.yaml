# This file defines hardware-specific settings for nova. If you use the same
# hardware profile as this environment, you should not need to change this file.
# Otherwise, you should review the settings here and adjust for your hardware.
# In particular:
# 1. vcpu_pin_set will change if the number of logical CPUs on the hardware
#    changes.
# 2. pci alias / passthrough_whitelist could change if the NIC type or NIC
#    slotting changes.
# TODO: Should move to global layer and become tied to the hardware profile
